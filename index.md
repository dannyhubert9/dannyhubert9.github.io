Hey there! I'm Danny Hubert, currently pursuing a dual major in Finance and Management at Lehigh University, with an anticipated graduation in May 2024. I am excited to bring a postiive attitude and commitment to excellence at Wells Fargo post-graduation in their Operations Development Program. At Lehigh University, Iâ€™ve been able to have a well rounded experience of financial and business education while exploring many of my personal interests as well. 

**Some of my experiences include:**
- **Internship Ventures:** From law firms to startups, and from Fidelity Investments to entrepreneurial endeavors, I've savored a spectrum of professional experiences.
- **Academic Milestones:** Anticipating a dual major in Finance and Management, coupled with a minor in Political Science upon my graduation in Spring 2024.
- **Community Recognition:** Honored as the "Livingston Youth Citizen of the Year" in 2019, highlighting my commitment to civic engagement runs deep.
- **Creative Pursuits:** Whether shaping narratives as an editor for a newspaper or crafting content across various mediums, storytelling is my passion.
- **Leadership Odyssey:** From presiding over my high school's largest club to stewarding as Treasurer of Lehigh's Accounting Club, I thrive in leadership roles.
- **Global Travels:** My journey spans Bethlehem to Barcelona, Boston to Boca Raton, and beyond, each destination enriching my perspective and providing me with countless memories.
- **Sports Enthusiast:** Endured the highs and lows of the Miami Heat's 2023-2024 season, a true test of resilience for last year's ECF champions.
