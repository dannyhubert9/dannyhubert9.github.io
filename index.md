- *Serving in numerous leadership positions, including President of my high school's largest club and Treasurer of Lehigh's Accounting Club*
- *Living in Bethlehem, Boston, Barcelona, The Berkshires, Boca Raton, Costa Rica, Tel Aviv, Livingston, and (soon) Charlotte*
- *Living through the Miami Heat 2023-2024 Season (seriously, it's be a rough season for last year's ECF champs)*
