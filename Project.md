# VSE Inc. Consulting Project - Spring 2024 (MGT 314)

## Overview
Our consulting engagement with VSE Inc. focuses on leveraging AI technology to enhance market strategy and operational efficiency. The project aims to explore the potential of AI-driven psychics to revolutionize client interactions and provide valuable insights through data analysis.

## Objectives
- Conduct research to identify the target market for VSE's new AI product.
- Assess the interest of current customers in the AI-driven psychic service.
- Explore opportunities for expanding into new markets.
- Develop a long-term business strategy for the evolution of the technology.

## Client Engagement Experience
Our client engagement experience with VSE Inc. provided invaluable insights and opportunities for growth. We had the chance to conduct in-depth research and analysis in the AI technology and psychic industry, culminating in a comprehensive report and final presentation to Eric Varady, our client.

## Changes in Approach/Methodology
Based on our experience, we would implement more defined roles from the beginning, emphasizing the use of databases and other sources for research. A direct line of communication with the company and key stakeholders, including a deeper dive into Eric's goals, will enhance our understanding and effectiveness.

## Changes in Scope
We propose a shift towards focusing more on branding strategy, testing/implementation, and neuroscience research. Less emphasis will be placed on defining a client base if already known, ensuring alignment with company goals from the start.

## Changes in Interactions
In future engagements, we plan to have more frequent text communications with the client, purpose-driven interactions with Prof. Ehrig, and increased in-person engagements with clients to simulate real-world interactions and improve outcomes.

## Changes in Personnel
Reflecting on team dynamics, future collaborations will prioritize working with effective team members while ensuring a conducive working environment. We acknowledge the strengths of certain team members while being mindful of compatibility and collaboration.

## Changes in Deliverables with Client
Enhancing the client experience involves expanding deliverables, encouraging in-person experiences, and extending project duration for deeper engagement and tangible results. We advocate for a two-semester project or longer to provide ample time for substantial contributions.

## Other Changes
We suggest longer engagement periods, more direct access to company resources, and increased professor feedback on deliverables to further enrich the consulting experience and drive better outcomes. Incorporating algorithm learning and gaining access to confidential company information will enhance our research capabilities and deliverables.

## Conclusion
Our consulting experience with VSE Inc. was a valuable journey that provided growth, learning, and meaningful contributions to our client's objectives. The project allowed us to make mistakes, facilitating room for growth, and was guided by a supportive client, Eric Varady, and Prof. Ehrig. We look forward to applying the lessons learned in future endeavors.
